	<h2>Journalism: Magazine and Feature Writing</h2>
	
	<p>I'm currently a journalism senior at the University of Florida in the College of Journalism and Communications.</p>
	<p>Originally, I'm from a little town called Green Cove Springs, which is about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.</p>
	<p>I absolutely love being a reporter - It's a great opportunity to constantly meet new people, listen to their stories and learn something new every day.
	<p>When people are passionate about what they have to tell me during an interview, I don't even seen reporting as a job, but instead I look at it as a great opportunity to tell their story and share their passion.
	<p>I couldn't be more proud to be the first person in my family's generation to attend the University of Florida. I could not be more proud to be a part of the Gator Nation.</p>
